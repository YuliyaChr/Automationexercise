# AutomationExercise Test Plan

## 1. Overview
AutomationExercise is a comprehensive practice website for automation engineers at all levels. It is a full-featured
e-commerce platform that provides realistic testing scenarios to help QA professionals develop and refine their
automation testing skills. The platform covers various functional areas including user management, product browsing,
cart operations, and order processing.

Additionally, AutomationExercise provides API test documentation and publicly available endpoints suitable for
functional API validation and for supporting UI automation.

## 2. Testing Objectives
- Validate user registration and authentication functionality
- Ensure proper shopping cart operations and checkout process
- Verify product browsing, search, and filtering capabilities
- Test payment and order placement functionality
- Validate data persistence and user account management
- Test responsive design and UI interactions
- Ensure proper error handling and validation messages

## 3. Testing Scope

### In Scope (UI):
- User Registration and Login (positive and negative scenarios)
- Product Browsing and Search
- Shopping Cart Management
- Checkout and Order Placement
- User Account Management
- Product Reviews
- Contact Us Form
- Payment Processing
- Invoice Download
- Subscription Feature
- Category and Brand Filtering
- Scroll Functionality

### In Scope (API):

- Authentication verification endpoints (e.g., login verification)
- Account management endpoints (e.g., create account, delete account if supported)
- Product catalog endpoints (e.g., list products, search products, category/brand filtering if supported)
- Form submission endpoints where documented (e.g., contact form)
- Negative API scenarios (invalid payload, missing required fields, invalid credentials)
- Contract checks (status codes, response schema/fields, error messages)

### Out of Scope:
- Mobile application testing
- Performance and Load testing
- Security penetration testing
- Third-party payment gateway integration details
- Deep backend validation not exposed by the public API

5. **API Testing – endpoint-level validation (functional + negative + contract checks)

### Testing Types:
- Functional Testing
- Regression Testing
- Smoke Testing
- Sanity Testing
- Boundary Value Testing
- Positive and Negative Testing

### Tools & Technologies:
- **Automation Framework:** Playwright (Python)
